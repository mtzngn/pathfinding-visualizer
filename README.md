### Pathfinding Visualizer   

##### I was studying algorithms and i found some visualization tools which were really helpful and fun to play with.   
##### So i decided to built one my self.   

You can check it out from here [https://mtzngn.github.io/sorting-algorithms-visualizer/].

If you want to run it locally;
First install the dependencies by running the following command in project directory:
### `npm install`
Than you can styart the app with following command:
### `npm start`

#### __Djkstra's__ and __A*__ pathfinding algorithms implemented.   
#### Next step is to add more pathfinding algorithms and add more maze generators.
